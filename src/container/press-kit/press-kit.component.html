                <p>
                    Ripped Pants at Work is a game about sneaking through a city, searching for new pants. Players control an ordinary office
                    worker on their first day of work. After an unfortunate incident involving a pencil on the floor and
                    pants that were way too tight, the player must venture out of the office and into the city on a hunt
                    for new pants.
                </p>

                <h3 style="font-family:fff_forward;">History</h3>
                <p>
                    Towards the end of 2016, Scott Ethington started making a new game every week as a way to relieve some creative buildup while
                    working at a dead-end QA job. The very first iteration of Ripped Pants at Work was one of those weekly
                    games. While most of the weekly games have received an average of about 15 total downloads on itch.io,
                    the one-week version of Ripped Pants has been downloaded over 3,000 times. This prompted the creation
                    of a bigger, better, and prettier version of Ripped Pants at Work, made from the ground up as it's own
                    game!
                </p>

                <h3 style="font-family:fff_forward;">Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sneak through a small, open-world, city, full of unique locations and people</li>
                    <li>Break line of sight, hide behind people and in bushes, and run across streets and through buildings with
                        a unique brand of stealth</li>
                    <li>Play the game as a different, randomly generated character every time. If you get caught pantsless by
                        too many people, you'll get fired for indecency. The cycle continues with the next person to get
                        hired for your job</li>
                    <li>Best your personal record and see how many pairs of pants you can get in the shortest amount of time!</li>
                </ul>
